    <section class="privacy-section">
        <h3>What This Policy Covers</h3>
        <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our website as "Services."</p>
        <p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have
            with respect to that information.</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to
            communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
        <p>We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically
            through operating our Services, and from outside sources.</p>

        <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
        <p>It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some
            examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic account information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up
                your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Public profile information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information
                that you provide for your public profile.</li>
            <li><strong>Content information:</strong> You might provide us with information about you in draft and
                published content.</li>
            <li><strong>Communications with us:</strong> You may also provide us with information when you communicate
                with us about a support question.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
        <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web
                browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services.</li>
            <li><strong>Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from
                your IP address.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How and Why We Use Information</h3>
        <p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide our Services</li>
            <li>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services</li>
            <li>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing</li>
            <li>To protect our Services, our users, and the public</li>
            <li>To communicate with you about offers, promotions, and other news about products and services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sharing Information</h3>
        <p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.</p>

        <h3>How Long We Keep Information</h3>
        <p>We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect
            and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we're not legally
            required to keep it.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against
            unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.</p>

        <h3>Your Rights</h3>
        <p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including some US states and countries that fall under the
            scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the "GDPR"), you may have certain rights
            regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>

        <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We
            encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>
